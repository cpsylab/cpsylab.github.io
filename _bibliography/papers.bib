abstract = {A system’s heterogeneity (diversity) is the effective size of its event space, and can be quantified using the Rényi family of indices (also known as Hill numbers in ecology or Hannah–Kay indices in economics), which are indexed by an elasticity parameter q≥0. Under these indices, the heterogeneity of a composite system (the γ-heterogeneity) is decomposable into heterogeneity arising from variation within and between component subsystems (the α- and β-heterogeneity, respectively). Since the average heterogeneity of a component subsystem should not be greater than that of the pooled system, we require that γ≥α. There exists a multiplicative decomposition for Rényi heterogeneity of composite systems with discrete event spaces, but less attention has been paid to decomposition in the continuous setting. We therefore describe multiplicative decomposition of the Rényi heterogeneity for continuous mixture distributions under parametric and non-parametric pooling assumptions. Under non-parametric pooling, the γ-heterogeneity must often be estimated numerically, but the multiplicative decomposition holds such that γ≥α for q{\textgreater}0. Conversely, under parametric pooling, γ-heterogeneity can be computed efficiently in closed-form, but the γ≥α condition holds reliably only at q=1. Our findings will further contribute to heterogeneity measurement in continuous systems.},

abstract = {Predicting lithium response (LiR) in bipolar disorder (BD) may inform treatment planning, but phenotypic heterogeneity complicates discovery of genomic markers. We hypothesized that patients with “exemplary phenotypes”—those whose clinical features are reliably associated with LiR and non-response (LiNR)—are more genetically separable than those with less exemplary phenotypes. Using clinical data collected from people with BD (n= 1266 across 7 centers; 34.7\% responders), we computed a “clinical exemplar score,” which measures the degree to which a subject’s clinical phenotype is reliably predictive of LiR/LiNR. For patients whose genotypes were available (n= 321), we evaluated whether a subgroup of responders/non-responders with the top 25\% of clinical exemplar scores (the “best clinical exemplars”) were more accurately classified based on genetic data, compared to a subgroup with the lowest 25\% of clinical exemplar scores (the “poor clinical exemplars”). On average, the best clinical exemplars of LiR had a later illness onset, completely episodic clinical course, absence of rapid cycling and psychosis, and few psychiatric comorbidities. The best clinical exemplars of LiR and LiNR were genetically separable with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.88 (IQR [0.83, 0.98]), compared to 0.66 [0.61, 0.80] (p= 0.0032) among poor clinical exemplars. Variants in the Alzheimer’s amyloid–secretase pathway, along with G-protein-coupled receptor, muscarinic acetylcholine, and histamine H1R signaling pathways were informative predictors. This study must be replicated on larger samples and extended to predict response to other mood stabilizers.},

abstract = {Normative modeling is an increasingly popular method for characterizing the ways in which clinical cohorts deviate from a reference population, with respect to one or more biological features. In this paper, we extend the normative modeling framework with an approach for measuring the amount of heterogeneity in a cohort. This heterogeneity measure is based on the Representational Rényi Heterogeneity method, which generalizes diversity measurement paradigms used across multiple scientific disciplines. We propose that heterogeneity in the normative modeling setting can be measured as the effective number of deviation patterns; that is, the effective number of coherent patterns by which a sample of data differ from a distribution of normative variation. We show that lower effective number of deviation patterns is associated with the presence of systematic differences from a (non-degenerate) normative distribution. This finding is shown to be consistent across (A) application of a Gaussian process model to synthetic and real-world neuroimaging data, and (B) application of a variational autoencoder to well-understood database of handwritten images.},

abstract = {A discrete system’s heterogeneity is measured by the Rényi heterogeneity family of indices (also known as Hill numbers or Hannah–Kay indices), whose units are the numbers equivalent. Unfortunately, numbers equivalent heterogeneity measures for non-categorical data require a priori (A) categorical partitioning and (B) pairwise distance measurement on the observable data space, thereby precluding application to problems with ill-defined categories or where semantically relevant features must be learned as abstractions from some data. We thus introduce representational Rényi heterogeneity (RRH), which transforms an observable domain onto a latent space upon which the Rényi heterogeneity is both tractable and semantically relevant. This method requires neither a priori binning nor definition of a distance function on the observable space. We show that RRH can generalize existing biodiversity and economic equality indices. Compared with existing indices on a beta-mixture distribution, we show that RRH responds more appropriately to changes in mixture component separation and weighting. Finally, we demonstrate the measurement of RRH in a set of natural images, with respect to abstract representations learned by a deep neural network. The RRH approach will further enable heterogeneity measurement in disciplines whose data do not easily conform to the assumptions of existing indices.},

abstract = {Predicting lithium response prior to treatment could both expedite therapy and avoid exposure to side effects. Since lithium responsiveness may be heritable, its predictability based on genomic data is of interest. We thus evaluate the degree to which lithium response can be predicted with a machine learning (ML) approach using genomic data. Using the largest existing genomic dataset in the lithium response literature (n = 2210 across 14 international sites; 29\% responders), we evaluated the degree to which lithium response could be predicted based on 47,465 genotyped single nucleotide polymorphisms using a supervised ML approach. Under appropriate cross-validation procedures, lithium response could be predicted to above-chance levels in two constituent sites (Halifax, Cohen’s kappa 0.15, 95\% confidence interval, CI [0.07, 0.24]; and Würzburg, kappa 0.2 [0.1, 0.3]). Variants with shared importance in these models showed over-representation of postsynaptic membrane related genes. Lithium response was not predictable in the pooled dataset (kappa 0.02 [− 0.01, 0.04]), although non-trivial performance was achieved within a restricted dataset including only those patients followed prospectively (kappa 0.09 [0.04, 0.14]). Genomic classification of lithium response remains a promising but difficult task. Classification performance could potentially be improved by further harmonization of data collection procedures.},

This review aims to identify existing genetic heterogeneity measurements in the psychiatric literature and provides a conceptual review of their mechanisms, limitations, and assumptions. The Scopus database was searched for studies that quantified genetic heterogeneity or correlation of psychiatric phenotypes with human genetic data. Ninety studies were included. Eighty-seven reports quantified genetic correlation, five applied genomic structural equation modelling, three evaluated departure from the Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium at one or more loci, and two applied a novel approach known as MiXeR. We found no study that rigorously measured genetic etiological heterogeneity across a large number of markers. Developing such approaches may help better characterize the biological diversity of psychopathology.},
