### About

We are a research group studying how computations in the brain generate bipolar disorder and its remarkable diversity. We are hosted by the [Department of Psychiatry](https://medicine.dal.ca/departments/department-sites/psychiatry.html) and [Faculty of Computer Science](https://www.dal.ca/faculty/computerscience.html) at [Dalhousie University](https://dal.ca) in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada.

### Research

Our work has two streams of work on bipolar disorder:  

1. **Computational neurobiology**
   - Where we use computational models of neurons, circuits, and cognitive systems to understand mechanisms by which brain abnormalities result in observable features of bipolar disorder

2. **Characterizing clinical and neurobiological diversity**  
  - Where we use and develop advanced statistical methods for the purpose of quantifying and characterizing diversity in bipolar disorder at biological and clinical levels. 
  - We focus a great deal on distinguishing lithium responsive from unresponsive bipolar disorder
